What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Ans. I am not very much clear with this thought but I think as git works manually meaning that it is user oriented and user 
has all the controll, so on that point we have to initialize a repository to manually set some work of mine to be tracked by 
git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Ans. Staging area basically as a interace between the working directory and the Repository. Itis basiclly an area where 
we can add files that are to be commited as one, whereas the working directory is the directory where your files are 
residing and repository is the area where the commits, that are being made are saved.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Ans. Staging area can be used for the crosscheck purpose by checking the change done in the working directory files to the 
previous files present in the staging area before doing any commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Ans. Situations when someone would be wanting to explore a different aspect after doing some work on the project or when
we want to test some scenarios for some enhancement or etc to the project. So in these scenarios the branches would help us
to distinguish between our goal(original) and extra(enhancement) work that is being done.
