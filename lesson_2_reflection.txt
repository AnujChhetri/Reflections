What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Ans. I am not very much clear with this thought but I think as git works manually meaning that it is user oriented and user 
has all the controll, so on that point we have to initialize a repository to manually set some work of mine to be tracked by 
git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Ans. Staging area basically as a interace between the working directory and the Repository. Itis basiclly an area where 
we can add files that are to be commited as one, whereas the working directory is the directory where your files are 
residing and repository is the area where the commits, that are being made are saved.
